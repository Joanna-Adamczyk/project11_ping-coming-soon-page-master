# Frontend Mentor - Ping coming soon page


## About the project

Your challenge was to build out this Coming Soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users can:<br>
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size<br>
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page<br>
- Submit their email address using an `input` field<br>
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:<br>
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*<br>
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*
